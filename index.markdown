I am a data scientist interested in natural language processing, intelligent document processing, computer vision, and
interpretable machine learning. I hold an MS in Computer Science from Duke University, and a BS in Mathematics from
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. *I'm on the job market, so check out my resume and GitHub if you're hiring.*

I enjoy competitive coding with my girlfriend, [Alina Jade Barnett](https://alinajadebarnett.github.io/). In 2019, we
won second prize in the Duke AI for Art Competition. In 2020, we were the 80th team from more than 100,000 global
contestants to complete [part one day four](https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard/day/4) of the annual Advent of
Code challenges. Check out my GitHub and Thingiverse for more on my personal interests and projects.
