I got the GitHub, LinkedIn, and PDF icons from:
https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/tree/master/_includes

I got the 3D printing icon from here:
https://icon-icons.com/icon/printer-3d-nozzle/135279

The PyPI logo is just a python logo for recognizability. I got it from wikimedia:
