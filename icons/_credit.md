# Credit for SVG images used

I have modified all of these SVGs in one way or another. The color of each has been lightened from black to a consistent gray that looks better on the blog (currently `#808080`). I have also modified the viewports and scaling so that they have the same height.

I got the GitHub, LinkedIn, and PDF icons from the [Basically Basic Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic/tree/master/_includes).

I got the 3D printing icon from [icon-icons.com](https://icon-icons.com/icon/printer-3d-nozzle/135279).

The PyPI logo is just the Python logo for recognizability. I previously used [this Python logo from wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Python_icon_%28black_and_white%29.svg), and it is still in the icons/ directory with modifications. I now use a version that I derived from the official [SVG format of only "two snakes"](https://s3.dualstack.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pythondotorg-assets/media/files/python-logo-only.svg) logo available on the [Python logo page](https://www.python.org/community/logos/).

The pen emoji for the link to my blog is from [streamlinehq.com](https://www.streamlinehq.com/emojis/download/fountain-pen--31902). I modified it by removing the fixed height and width.
